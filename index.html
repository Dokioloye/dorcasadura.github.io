    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p> 
        My name is Dorcas Adebayo, an inquisitive student, I love learning new things. I'm currently enrolled
        in the School of Engineering, studying Front-end Engineering. Since childhood, I have been curious on
        how things work, the technology behind it. This led me to study Mechatronics engineering in school 
        and also the reason I applied for front-end engineering.
